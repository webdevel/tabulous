### Features
Shows the tab page number on every tab label for quickly navigating to the desired tab **`<number>gt`**.
Rename the current tab page label.
Tabs display an indicator when a buffer has been modified and not saved.
Dynamically updates the filename of the currently focused window in the tab page.
Eliminates inefficient use of string concatenation operator by using **`printf`** where possible.
Does not show filename extensions to preserve the amount of tab label space.
Performs runtime calculation of maximum tab label length and truncates accordingly (Dynamic resizing of tab labels).
Options are configurable from **`.vimrc`**.

##### Planned Features
Enhancement of tab label truncation algorithm
Toggle tab page numbers on and off by keyboard shortcut
Toggle tab label filename extensions on and off by keyboard shortcut
Toggle tab label truncation on and off by keyboard shortcut
> In progress: keyboard shortcuts and enhancement of tab label truncation algorithm.

### Configuration
No configuration is necessary by default. However, there are options if you want to set them. Any of the following configuration options may simply be added to a new line in your **`.vimrc`**.

##### Disable Plugin
This disables the plugin entirely.
```sh
let g:loadTabulous = 1
```

##### Tab Label Truncation
This enables or disables tab page label truncation. The default is **`1`** enabled.
```sh
let g:tabulousLabelNameTruncate = 0
```

##### Tab Close
This sets the tab close string for mouse clicks. The default is **`X`** enabled.
```sh
let g:tabulousCloseStr = ''
```

##### Tab Label Name Options
This sets the tab label name options which may be valid [filename-modifiers] recognized by the Vim command **`fnamemodify`**. The defaults are **`:t:r`** which remove directories and file extension from a tab label name.
```sh
let g:tabulousLabelNameOptions = ''
```

##### Tab Label Modified
This sets the string that indicates the buffer associated with a tab has been modified, but not yet saved. The default value is shown below.
```sh
let g:tabulousLabelModifiedStr = '+'
```

##### Tab Label Left

### Keyboard Shortcuts

There are no default mappings for renaming your tabs, but you can map it easily like this:

```vimL
map <C-t> :call g:tabulous#renameTab()<cr>
```

This maps `Ctrl + t` to rename your tab.
